              <li><strong>Data transparency</strong> - We clearly indicate the source and freshness of all displayed data</li>
              <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - We strive to make our site usable by everyone, regardless of ability</li>

            <h2>Why Food Hygiene Ratings Matter</h2>
            <p>Food hygiene ratings help you make informed choices about where to eat out or shop for food. The ratings show how well a business is meeting the requirements of food hygiene law, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Food handling practices</li>
              <li>The condition of facilities and buildings</li>
              <li>How the business manages and records what it does to make sure food is safe</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>By making this information more accessible, we aim to help improve public health and support businesses that maintain high standards.</p>
