A static site generator that creates HTML pages from the UK Food Hygiene Rating
Scheme (FHRS) API data.

## Features

- Fetches data from FHRS API for all local authorities
- Generates individual HTML pages for each establishment
- Creates a sitemap for SEO
- Handles both English and Scottish rating schemes (FHRS/FHIS)
- Supports concurrent processing for faster generation
- Includes rating images and geolocation links

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker (for development container)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/food-hygiene-uk/main-site-builder.git
cd main-site-builder

# Using Dev Container (recommended)
code .
# Then "Reopen in Container" when prompted

# Or run directly with Deno
deno cache [generate-site.mts](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)
```

## Usage

```bash
# Generate the static site
deno task build
